# Basic Interactions

Start Retro in interactive mode:

```
retro -i
```

You should see something similar to this:

    Retro 12 (2021.7)
    8388608 MAX, TIB @ 1025, Heap @ 9374

At this point you are at the *listener*, which reads and
processes your input. You are now set to begin exploring
Retro.

Retro is normally silent; unlike other Forth systems, it
does not display an "ok" prompt.

To exit, run `bye`:

```
bye
```
