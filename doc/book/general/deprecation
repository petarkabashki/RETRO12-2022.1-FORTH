# Deprecation Policy

As Retro evolves, some words will become obsolete and no longer be
needed. In each release, these will be marked as deprecated in the
glossary. Any deprecated words will be removed in the next quarterly
release.

E.g., if 2020.1 had deprecated words, these would be removed in the
2020.4 release. Any words made deprecated in between 2020.1 and
2020.4 would be removed in the 2020.7 release.
