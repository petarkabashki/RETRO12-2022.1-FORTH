# Checking The Version

RETRO releases add and change things. You can use the `Version`
variable to determine the version in use and react accordingly.

```
@Version #201906 eq? [ 'Needs_2019.6! s:put nl bye ] if
```

This can be also be used to conditionally load compatibility files:

```
(If_newer_than_2016.6,_load_aliases_for_renamed_words)
@Version #201906 gt? [ 'Renamed_2019.6.forth include ] if
```

## Version Number Format

The version is a six digit number encoding the year and month of
the release. So:

    201901  is  2019.1
    201906  is  2019.6
    201911  is  2019.11

A `#100 /mod` will suffice to split these if needed.
