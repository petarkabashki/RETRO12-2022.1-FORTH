RETRO-EMBEDIMAGE
     retro-embedimage - a modern, pragmatic forth development system

SYNOPSIS
     retro-embedimage [filename]

DESCRIPTION
     RETRO is a modern, pragmatic Forth drawing influences from many sources.
     It's clean, elegant, tiny, and easy to grasp and adapt to various uses.

     retro-embedimage loads the specified image (or `ngaImage` from the
     current directory if none is specified). It converts this into C code
     that can be compiled for inclusion in a RETRO executable.	It will write
     the output to stdout.
