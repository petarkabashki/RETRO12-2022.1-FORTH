RETRO-EXTEND
     retro-extend - a modern, pragmatic forth development system

SYNOPSIS
     retro-extend image filename [filenames]

DESCRIPTION
     RETRO is a modern, pragmatic Forth drawing influences from many sources.
     It's clean, elegant, tiny, and easy to grasp and adapt to various uses.

     retro-extend is a tool to load additional code into an image file. It
     takes the name of an image file and one or more source files to load into
     the image. After completion the image file will be updated with the
     changes.


CAVEATS
     retro-extend only emulates the minimal console output device. If the
     source files require additional I/O to be present, the extend process
     will likely fail to work correctly.
