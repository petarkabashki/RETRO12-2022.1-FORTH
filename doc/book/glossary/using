# Using The Glossary

The Glossary is a valuable resource. It provides information
on the RETRO words.

## Example Entry

    f:+

      Data:  -
      Addr:  -
      Float: FF-F

    Add two floating point numbers, returning the result.

    Class: class:word | Namespace: f | Interface Layer: rre

    Example #1:

        .3.1 .22 f:+

## Reading The Entry

An entry starts with the word name.

This is followed by the stack effect for each stack. All RETRO
systems have Data and Address stacks, some also include a
floating point stack).

The stack effect diagrams are followed by a short description
of the word.

After the description is a line providing some useful data. This
includes the class handler, namespace prefix, and the interface
layer that provides the word.

Words in all systems will be listed as `all`. Some words (like
the `pb:` words) are only on specific systems like iOS. These
can be identified by looking at the interface layer field.

At the end of the entry may be an example or two.
