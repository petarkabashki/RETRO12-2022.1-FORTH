# Obtaining Retro

## Stable Releases

I periodically make stable releases. This will typically happen
quarterly.

- http://forthworks.com/retro
- http://forth.works

## Snapshots

A lot of development happens between releases. I make snapshots
of my working source tree nightly (and often more often).

The latest snapshot can be downloaded from the following stable
URLs:

* http://forthworks.com/retro/r/latest.tar.gz
* gopher://forthworks.com/9/retro/r/latest.tar.gz

## Fossil Repository

I use a Fossil repository to manage development. To obtain a
copy of the repository install Fossil and:

    fossil clone http://forthworks.com:8000 retro.fossil
    mkdir retro
    cd retro
    fossil open /path/to/retro.fossil

See the Fossil documentation for details on using Fossil to
keep your local copy of the repository current.

This will let you stay current with my latest changes faster
than the snapshots, but you may occasionally encounter bigger
problems as some commits may be in a partially broken state.

If you have problems, check the version of Fossil you are
using. I am currently using Fossil 2.10, you may experience
issues checking out or cloning if using older versions.

## git Repository

There is now a read-only mirror of the fossil repository
provided via git. This is hosted on sr.ht.

    git clone https://git.sr.ht/~crc_/retroforth

## Notes

I personally recommend using either a recent snapshot or a
build from one of the repositories. This will reflect the
latest system as I use it, and are normally reliable as I
run them daily for my production systems.
