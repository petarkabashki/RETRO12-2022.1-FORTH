# Building on BSD, Linux, macOS, and other Unix Targets

Retro is well supported on BSD (tested on FreeBSD, NetBSD,
OpenBSD), Linux, and macOS systems. It should build on any
of these without issue.

## Requirements

- c compiler & linker
- standard headers
- make

## Process

For a standard 32-bit system:

Run `make`

This will build the toolchain and then the main `retro`
executable.

## Executables

In the `bin/` directory, you should see the following:

    retro
    retro-unu
    retro-muri
    retro-extend
    retro-embedimage
    retro-describe

## Test The Build

You can conduct a quick test of the build by running `bin/retro`:

    ./bin/retro

Exit by typing `bye` and pressing enter.

## Installation

You can install Retro globally on BSD systems (and possibly Linux)
by doing:

    doas make install

or:

    sudo make install

## Platform Specific Notes

### Linux

To build on Linux, you need to link with *libdl* if using the optional
FFI. To do this, edit the `GNUmakefile` and uncomment this before building:

    # LIBDL += -ldl

### Haiku

To build on Haiku, you need to link with the *network* library if using
sockets. E.g.:

    make LDFLAGS=-lnetwork

## Issues

If you run into any build issues, please send details to
crc@forth.works so I can work on addressing them as quickly
as possible.
