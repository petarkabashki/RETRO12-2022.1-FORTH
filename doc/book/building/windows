# Building Retro on Windows

It is possible to build Retro on Windows, though a few of the
extensions are not supported:

- no `unix:` words
- no `gopher:` words

This is currently more difficult than on a Unix host. If you have
Windows 10 and WSL, it may be better to build under that (using
the Unix instructions).

## Setup Build Environment

Retro on Windows is built with TCC.

Go to http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/tinycc/

Download the *winapi-full* and *tcc-xxxx-bin* packages for your
system. Decompress them, copy the headers from the winapi
package into the tcc directory.

## Prepare Source

Copy the `vm/nga-c/retro.c` and the `vm/nga-c/image.c` to
the directory you setup tcc into.

## Build

Building will require use of the command line. Assuming that
tcc.exe is in the current directory along with the Retro sources:

    tcc retro.c -o retro.exe
