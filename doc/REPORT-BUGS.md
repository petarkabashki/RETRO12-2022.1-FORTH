# Reporting Bugs

Bugs can be reported via the IRC channel, by sending me a
message on Mastodon, or via email.

**IRC**

Join #retro on irc.libera.chat or irc.oftc.net.

If you ask a question, please be patient. The channel has large
idle times, but is logged (see forthworks.com/retro/irc-logs)
and I generally try to answer questions in a reasonable time
period.
