This is used to assemble the Markdown copy of the RETRO Handbook.

The individual chapters are in the `book/` directory. This is set
using the `BOOK-BASE` constant.

'doc/book/  'BOOK-BASE s:const

The chapters are specified it the `TOC`, a named array. These are
the file names, they will be included in order. I am structuring
it using separate file to make the actual editing process easier
for me.
