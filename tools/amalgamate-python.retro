# Amalgamate

The standard RETRO system is built using the Nga VM[1] and an
image file. The Python implementation consists of several files,
but it's nice to have a single file copy for easier deployment.
This tool combines the pieces into a single source file.

Output will be written to stdout.

## Code

Extract and generate the single file source.
