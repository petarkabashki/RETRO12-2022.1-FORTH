This is a small tool I wrote to let me quickly share code on IRC
or via other channels.

First, get the MD5 of the source. Start by construting a pipe:

~~~
#0 script:get-argument 'md5_%s s:format file:R unix:popen 'FID const
~~~

Then read in until past the prolog (MD5 filename = ...):

~~~
[ FID file:read $= eq? ] until FID file:read drop
~~~

And then read in the sum and close the pipe. The sum in kept
in a string constant MD5.

~~~
#1000 [ FID file:read , ] here &times dip s:chop 'MD5 s:const
FID unix:pclose
~~~

Next, I construct string constants for the destination file
and URL's for Gopher and HTTPS.

~~~
MD5 '/home/crc/public/share/%s        s:format 'DEST s:const
MD5 'http://forth.works/share/%s      s:format 'HTTP s:const
MD5 'gopher://forth.works/0/share/%s  s:format 'GOPH s:const
~~~

Then copy the source file to the destination directory.

~~~
here #0 script:get-argument file:slurp here DEST file:spew
~~~

And finally display the URL's.

~~~
HTTP s:put nl
GOPH s:put nl
~~~
