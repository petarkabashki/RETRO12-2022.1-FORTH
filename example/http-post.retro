Typically to deal with HTTP I just use curl(1), but it is possible to
make HTTP requests using the sockets vocabulary. It's just a pain to
do so as HTTP has a lot of annoyances.

This example provides a way to make HTTP requests using only RETRO.

First, some variables. I'll keep the socket handle in `Socket` and the
number of bytes read in `Read`.

~~~
'Socket var
'Read   var
~~~

Since HTTP allows for a large number of response headers with various
sizes and ordering, skipping them can be annoying. I do care about one:
the Content-Length: result.

I'll track the number of sequential newlines in a variable named `Seq`,
the value for Content-Length in `Length`, and then the current response
line in `Line`.

As a bonus annoyance, HTTP doesn't limit the size of any particular
header line, so I need to allocate enough space to cover anything it
throws at me. Per a stackoverflow posting at
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/686217/maximum-on-http-header-values
I'll need at least 8KiB, so:

~~~
'Length var
'Seq    var
'Line   var #8192 allot
~~~

Then skipping the headers is a matter of reading lines until two newlines
are encountered.

~~~
:read-byte    here #1 @Socket socket:recv drop-pair here fetch ;
:append       dup buffer:add ;
:eol?         [ ASCII:LF eq? ] [ ASCII:CR eq? ] bi or ;
:is-length?   &Line 'Content-Length:_ s:begins-with? ;
:process      &Line s:trim #16 + s:to-number !Length ;
:next         &Line buffer:set ;
:yes          &Seq v:inc ;
:no           #0 !Seq ;
:check        [ yes is-length? [ process ] if next ] [ no ] choose ;
:read-line    read-byte append eol? check ;
:done?        @Seq #4 eq? ;
:skip-headers [ &Line buffer:set [ read-line done? ] until ] buffer:preserve ;
~~~

Now on to making the actual request to the server. An HTTP PUT request
takes a form like:

  POST <file> HTTP/1.1
  Host: domain
  Content-Type: text/plain
  Content-Length: <size>

  <parameters>

So I begin by writing a word to parse a URL. It'll store pointers to the
parts in the `Host` and `Request` variables. This is pretty easy. I
increase the starting point by 7 to skip over the HTTP:// part and then
split on the first / character to separate the domain and requested file.
This also takes a second string with the parameters to pass.

~~~
'Host     var
'Request  var
'Params   var

:parse-url #7 + $/ s:split/char s:keep !Host s:keep !Request s:keep !Params ;
~~~

Given that, making a request is simply:

~~~
:make-request
  @Params dup s:length @Host @Request
  'POST_%s_HTTP/1.1\r\nHost:_%s\r\nContent-Type:_text/plain\r\nContent-Length:_%n\r\n\r\n%s\r\n
  s:format @Socket socket:send drop-pair ;
~~~

Moving on to reading the body, this is just reading bytes and shoving
them into a buffer. I use the `Read` variable to track the number of
bytes read, stopping when this reaches the `Length` extracted from the
headers.

~~~
:read-byte here #1 @Socket socket:recv drop-pair here fetch buffer:add ;
:read-body [ &Read v:inc read-byte @Read @Length eq? ] until ;
~~~

And finally tieing this all together:

~~~
:http:post (ass-n)
  parse-url
  #0 !Seq #0 !Read
  socket:create !Socket @Host '80 socket:configure
  @Socket socket:connect drop-pair
  [ buffer:set make-request skip-headers read-body ] buffer:preserve @Read ;
~~~

And a test case:

```
'Body d:create #90000 allot
&Body 'hand=wave&test=true 'http://httpbin.org/post http:post
&Body s:put
```
