This directory contains the signing keys for the current and
next release of RETRO. The signature files for releases will
be generated using the OpenBSD signify tool.

Releases are generally planned to be quarterly; so the first
release would be 2021.01, and the second would be 2021.04.

Additional keys are also included, but will only be used if
there are unplanned releases to fix significant issues that
arise outside of the standard release schedule.

For 2021, the planned releases are:

  January: 2021.01
  April:   2021.04
  July:    2021.07
  October: 2021.10
